# plcc

This was an attempt to expand on a school compiler project [Pl Compiler](https://github.com/strinsberg/pl_compiler). I tried to learn some compiler tools for the front end and expanded on the vm provided for the school project. Overall, it is kind of big and messy, though it mostly did what I wanted it to.
